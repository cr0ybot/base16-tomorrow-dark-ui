# Atom Base16 Tomorrow Dark UI Theme

I couldn't find a UI theme that matched my favorite syntax theme, Base16 Tomorrow Dark, which is now part of the [core Atom repository](https://github.com/atom/atom/tree/master/packages/base16-tomorrow-dark-theme).

So I made one myself.

UI styling heavily influenced by Atom's [One Dark UI theme](https://github.com/atom/atom/tree/master/packages/one-dark-ui).
